/**
 * Positioning hints for aligning a window relative to a rectangle.
 *
 * These hints determine how the window should be positioned in the case that
 * the surface would fall off-screen if placed in its ideal position.
 *
 * For example, \p mir_placement_hints_flip_x will invert the x component of
 * \p aux_rect_placement_offset and replace \p mir_placement_gravity_northwest
 * with \p mir_placement_gravity_northeast and vice versa if the window extends
 * beyond the left or right edges of the monitor.
 *
 * If \p mir_placement_hints_slide_x is set, the window can be shifted
 * horizontally to fit on-screen.
 *
 * If \p mir_placement_hints_resize_x is set, the window can be shrunken
 * horizontally to fit.
 *
 * If \p mir_placement_hints_antipodes is set then the rect gravity may be
 * substituted with the opposite corner (e.g. \p mir_placement_gravity_northeast
 * to \p mir_placement_gravity_southwest) in combination with other options.
 *
 * When multiple flags are set, flipping should take precedence over sliding,
 * which should take precedence over resizing.
